# Graphics Application (Module Project)
As part of my **Applied Maths and Graphics** module, we were tasked with developing a small graphics application to reflect all of the techniques and formulas we have worked on over the past year. I definitely learnt that there is a surprisingly large amount of maths involved in simply changing the filter on an image.

### Let's get it to work!
It's a fairly simple process to get this application running so that you can fiddle about with it:
* Ensure that you have [processing](https://processing.org/download/) installed so that you can run the files.
* You'll then need to clone this repository or download it's contents.  
`git clone https://github.com/Hannah-Ashna/Graphics-Application.git`
* Navigate to **Graphics_Application.pde**, open it in processing and run

### What can it do?
Details of what this little application is capable of doing are outlined in the [checklist](https://github.com/Hannah-Ashna/Graphics-Application/blob/main/AMG%20Graphics%20Checklist%20for%20Submission%202021.docx) I was provided with for this module. Within the checklist it also includes instructions on how to access each feature.

### Test Data:
You can pretty much use any image you'd like to mess with this application, however, for our assessment of the application we were provided with this image of apples.

### G4P GUI Library:
This project uses the [G4P](http://lagers.org.uk/g4p/index.html) GUI Library for well ... my Graphical User Interface. I did not use their G4P GUI Builder tool for this project as I was looking to try and challenge myself a little bit more with this project. However, from my understanding it is a pretty effective tool for those looking to quickly jumpstart their GUIs in Processing.
